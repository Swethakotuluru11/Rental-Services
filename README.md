----------Rental Services---------------
Rental Services is an online platform that facilitates the process of renting properties. It connects Tenants (those seeking to rent a property) with Owners (property landlords). The system offers a seamless way for users to manage properties, make bookings, handle payments, and generate rental agreements.

Features:
1. User Authentication:
Users can sign up and log in to the platform.
Two types of users are supported:
Tenant: Can search for available properties, view property details, and make bookings.
Owner: Can manage their listed properties, view bookings, and update property information.
2. Property Management:
Owners can add, update, or delete their property listings.
Tenants can search for available properties based on criteria like location, price, and availability.
Tenants can view property details, including descriptions, images, price, and Owner Details.
3. Booking Management:
Tenants can book available properties directly from the platform.
The system ensures the property is available for the selected dates before confirming the booking.
Booking History: Tenants and Owners can view past bookings and upcoming reservations.
4. Payment Processing:
Tenants can securely make payments for their bookings via the integrated payment system.
The system supports various payment methods, ensuring secure transactions.
Once the payment is successful, a Rental Agreement is generated for the Tenant and sent to both the Tenant and Owner.
5. Rental Agreement:
After the Tenant makes a successful payment, the system generates a rental agreement, outlining the terms and conditions of the lease.
This agreement can be downloaded or printed for both Tenant and Owner.
6. User Dashboard:
Tenants and Owners have access to a personalized dashboard where they can view their details, manage bookings, and track payment history.
7. Search Filters:
Tenants can search for properties based on:
Location
Price range
Type of property (e.g., apartment, house)
Availability dates
8. Communication:
Tenants can contact Owners directly via the platform to ask questions or request additional information before making a booking.
System Design Overview:
